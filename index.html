            <strong>Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light,
              either electronically by means of an image sensor,
              or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film.
              It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography),
              and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production,
              recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication.

              Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into
              a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure.
              With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel,
              which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing.
              The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically "developed" into a visible image,
              either negative or positive depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing.
              A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base,
              known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact printing.</strong>

              <h4>1. Authentic and candid portraits</h4>
              <p> 
                Authenticity was a buzzword throughout 2019 and this year,
                we’ll be seeing the candid trend creep through into the visual arts.<br> 
                
                The stilted days of carefully composed travel photos are coming to an end 
                as people rebel against the images of perfection you find on social media.<br> 
              
              </p>
              <h4>2. Vertical imagery and portrait mode</h4>
              <p>
                Influenced by smartphone technology and native social media formats, the photography world
                is increasingly embracing the portrait mode as the preferred orientation. 
              </p>
              <h4>3. Vivid colours</h4>
              <p>
                Attention-grabbing vibrant colours are predicted to be big in 2020; look out
                for bold colours such as saturated orange and purple.<br>
                Alternatively, find colour-intense subjects, such as graffiti, wall paintings,
                and other vivid designs in your surroundings.<br>  
                hutterstock predicted 2020 colour trends that reflect the deep
                richness of Blue Hour, with three “hot” colours for 2020:<br>
               
              </p>
              <h4>4. Natural elements</h4>
              <p>With a rise in environmental activism, nature is set to have a greater
                 presence in photography in 2020.<br>
                 “Going green” in photography can mean anything from heading outside for environmental
                  photography to featuring natural elements in stills and product photography.<br> 
                This trend instils harmony and tranquillity in scenes while adding soft background elements.
              </p>
              <h4>5. 360 photography</h4>
              <p>Immersive photography such as 360 photography is perhaps the newest mode of visual expression.
                 Reflecting the trend in virtual reality, it’s starting to gain momentum.<br>

                360 photography refers to videos and photos that cover a 360-degree spectrum,
                 so they pull you into a scene and allow you to see it from every angle.<br> 
                
                
              <h4>6. Aerial photography</h4>
              <p>Drones are becoming more advanced and yet cheaper,
                 making them accessible to more and more people.<br> 
              </p>
              <h4>7. Diverse subjects</h4>
              <p>2020 is the year for reversing stereotypes in photography. Photographers will be looking to create better 
                collages of human portraits, with diverse representation and inclusivity.<br>
                In everything from billboard photos and catalogues to social media, there will be a greater 
                depiction of body types, genders, orientations, and racial diversities. 
               </p>
              <h4>8. Cinemagraphs</h4>
              <p>Cinemagraphs are still images with a suggestion of motion in just one element 
                (for example, in the swaying of grass or the gentle movement of water). <br>
